# Documentation-First Workflow

## Rule: Check Local Docs Before Everything Else

When answering ANY technical question about this project:

### Step 1: Read Local Documentation FIRST
```
1. docs/svelte 5/svelte.md (Svelte 5 API reference)
2. docs/svelte 5/svelte_rules.md (Project best practices)
3. docs/maplibre_svelte_docs.md (Map library docs)
4. Any other relevant docs/ files
```

### Step 2: State Your Sources
Always tell the user:
- "I checked [specific local files]"
- "Based on your local documentation..."
- "Your docs don't mention X, so I'm supplementing with..."

### Step 3: External Sources (Only If Needed)
- Use web search ONLY if local docs are insufficient
- Always mention you checked local docs first

## Violation Consequences
If you skip local documentation:
- User should immediately stop you
- You must restart the answer properly
- This wastes user time and should be avoided

## Examples

✅ **CORRECT:**
"I checked your docs/svelte 5/svelte.md and found that SvelteMap..."

❌ **WRONG:**
"Let me search the web for SvelteMap information..." (without checking local docs first)
