Anything you put inside static/ gets copied as-is to the root of your built site.

After npm run build, these will be available at:

https://your-site.com/data/pngp_grid_140m_topo.json
https://your-site.com/data/pngp_grid_1km_topo.json

So if your JSON file lives at static/data/pngp_grid_140m_topo.json, then fetching it works like this:

const res = await fetch('/data/pngp_grid_140m_topo.json');
